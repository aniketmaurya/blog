Hi there! I'm Aniket, a self-taught **Machine Learning Engineer** with a major in Computer Science.
Currently, I'm working on open-source projects at **Lightning AI** as a **Developer Advocate**.
I have experience in building and deploying machine learning systems at scale for Blibli, an e-commerce giant.
I enjoy tinkering with open-source tools and have created [Gradsflow](https://docs.gradsflow.com/) and [Chitra](https://github.com/aniketmaurya/chitra), 
both open-source machine learning and AI tools designed to assist developers in solving ML problems more efficiently.

## DevRel Experience

I joined Lightning AI (formerly PyTorch Lightning) after being a community contributor and core maintainer of [Lightning Flash](https://lightning-flash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/governance.html). I made significant contributions from the library's launch day and hosted meetups and workshops to educate developers.

I have been working on building the community, creating technical content, and using my engineering skills to build flagship products. Some of my achievements here are:

- Grew the London community by 10x and hosted multiple in-person community [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/london-deep-learning-by-lightning-ai/).
- Created high-quality content that drove the majority of the traffic to the [Lightning.ai](http://Lightning.ai) website. My blog was trending on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36068850) as well.
- Live-streamed about LLMs and distributed model training on our brand Discord channel, growing the community to more than 1K.
- Managed [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lightningAI/) and LinkedIn for posting technical content and driving engagements with the developer community.

## Engineering Experience

Before becoming a devrel, I was a Machine Learning engineer (I still consider myself an AI engineer) at a startup where I worked on training and deploying models in production. I scaled ML services to millions of requests per hour with a messaging queue, automatic batching, and several other optimizations. My open-source project (Chitra) is being used in production.

Recently, I have been contributing to [Lit-GPT](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt) (an open-source LLM training and finetuning library). I have implemented the LLM evaluation framework LM-Eval Harness and HELM (Stanfordâ€™s evaluation framework) for better evaluation of LLMs.

I built the flagship product for Lightning AI, [Muse](https://github.com/Lightning-Universe/stable-diffusion-deploy), where I deployed stable diffusion and scaled it to 1K+ concurrency.
