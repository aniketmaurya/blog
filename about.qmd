üëã I am a Developer Advocate at [Lightning AI](https://lightning.ai/) ü•ë‚ö°Ô∏è.

I have created two Python libraries, [Gradsflow](https://github.com/gradsflow/gradsflow) and [Chitra](https://chitra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), with the aim of simplifying AutoML and MLOps.

My passion lies in building problem-solving products that leverage Artificial Intelligence. I have expertise in building and deploying scalable Deep Learning systems in production.

I believe in continuous learning, open-source, and knowledge sharing. I started my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRuFsj94hWecPkuEr4f5Xww) to share educational video tutorials and tech meetups on Machine Learning and Python Software development.
