Hi there! I'm Aniket, a **Machine Learning - Software Engineer** with with over 4 years of experience, demonstrating a strong track record in developing and deploying machine learning models to production.

Currently, I'm working on building LLM-powered products and contributing to open source at Lightning AI ⚡️.


At Lightning AI, I have been working on on a wide range of AI products and use-cases as well as lead the open-source community.
Some of my contributions include:

* Designed and developed the flagship image generation product using Stable Diffusion, [Muse](https://lightning.ai/pages/community/tutorial/deploy-diffusion-models/).
* Increased model serving throughput efficiency by more than *50%* by implementing dynamic batching.
* Designed and developed *[Chat with PDF](https://lightning.ai/lightning-ai/studios/document-chat-assistant-using-rag)*, a RAG application using Large Language Models (LLMs).
* Enabled LLM evaluation by integrating Eval-Harness framework and Stanford's HELM with [Lit-GPT](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt).


Before joining Lightning AI, I was at [Quinbay](https://www.linkedin.com/company/quinbay/), a startup based in Bangalore, where I built and deployed deep learning models in production for our partner Blibli.com.

* Built and deployed Image Recognition system to block objectionable content, scaled for 10M requests.
* Reduced the Merchant Onboarding time from 24 hours to 1 second with a real-time ID Card Verification & Autofill System.
* Introduced a Face Recognition System for fraud detection in the e-commerce wallet, which reduced the manual process by more than 50%.


You can find most of my new blogs on LLMs, Distributed Training, and Machine Learning on [Lightning AI's blog](https://lightning.ai/pages/author/aniket-maurya/).
