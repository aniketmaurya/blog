Hi there! I'm Aniket, a self-taught **Machine Learning Engineer** with a background in Computer Science & Engineering.

Currently, I'm working on open-source projects at **Lightning AI** as a **Developer Advocate**.

You can find most of my new blogs on LLMs, Distributed Training, and Machine Learning on [Lightning AI's blog](https://lightning.ai/pages/author/aniket-maurya/).
