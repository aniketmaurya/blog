Hi there! I'm Aniket, a self-taught **Machine Learning Engineer** with a major in Computer Science & Engineering.

Currently, I'm working on open-source projects at **Lightning AI** as a **Developer Advocate**.

Most of my new blogs on LLMs, Distributed Training and Machine Learning can be found at [lightning.ai/blog](https://lightning.ai/blog).
