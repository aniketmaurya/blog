FastAPI is a high-performance asynchronous framework for building APIs in Python.
It provides support for Swagger UI out of the box.

# hello-world of FastAPI

First, we import `FastAPI` class and create an object `app`. This class has useful [parameters](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/a6897963d5ff2c836313c3b69fc6062051c07a63/fastapi/applications.py#L30) like we can pass the title and description for Swagger UI.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI(title='Hello world', description='This is a hello world example', version='0.0.1')
```

We define a function and decorate it with `@app.get`. This means that our API ``/index`` supports the GET method. The function defined here is **async**, FastAPI automatically takes care of async and without async methods by creating a thread pool for the normal def functions and it uses an async event loop for async functions.

```python
@app.get('/index')
async def hello_world():
    return "hello world"
```


# Pydantic support

One of my favorite features offered by FastAPI is Pydantic support. We can define Pydantic models and request-response will be handled by FastAPI for these models.
Let's create a COVID-19 symptom checker API to understand this.

# Covid-19 symptom checker API
We create a request body, it is the format in which the client should send the request. It will be used by Swagger UI.
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Symptom(BaseModel):
    fever: bool = False
    dry_cough: bool = False
    tiredness: bool = False
    breathing_problem: bool = False
```

Let's create a function to assign a risk level based on the inputs.

> This is just for learning and should not be used in real life, better consult a doctor.

```python
def get_risk_level(symptom: Symptom):
    if not (symptom.fever or symptom.dry_cough or symptom.tiredness or symptom.breathing_problem):
        return 'Low risk level. THIS IS A DEMO APP'

    if not (symptom.breathing_problem or symptom.dry_cough):
        if symptom.fever:
            return 'moderate risk level. THIS IS A DEMO APP'

    if symptom.breathing_problem:
        return 'High-risk level. THIS IS A DEMO APP'

    return 'THIS IS A DEMO APP'

```

Let's create the API for checking the symptoms

```python
@app.post('/api/covid-symptom-check')
def check_risk(symptom: Symptom):
    return get_risk_level(symptom)
```


# Image recognition API

We will create an API to classify images, we name it `predict/image`.
We will use Tensorflow for creating the image classification model.

> Tutorial for [Image Classification with Tensorflow](https://aniketmaurya.ml/blog/tensorflow/deep%20learning/2019/05/12/image-classification-with-tf2.html)

We create a function `load_model`, which will return a MobileNet CNN Model with pre-trained weights i.e. it is already trained to classify 1000 unique categories of images.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

def load_model():
    model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(weights="imagenet")
    print("Model loaded")
    return model

model = load_model()
```

We define a `predict` function that will accept an image and returns the predictions.
We resize the image to 224x224 and normalize the pixel values to be in **[-1, 1]**.

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications.imagenet_utils import decode_predictions
```
`decode_predictions` is used to decode the class name of the predicted object.
Here we will return the top-2 probable class.

```python
def predict(image: Image.Image):

    image = np.asarray(image.resize((224, 224)))[..., :3]
    image = np.expand_dims(image, 0)
    image = image / 127.5 - 1.0

    result = decode_predictions(model.predict(image), 2)[0]

    response = []
    for i, res in enumerate(result):
        resp = {}
        resp["class"] = res[1]
        resp["confidence"] = f"{res[2]*100:0.2f} %"

        response.append(resp)

    return response
```

Now we will create an API `/predict/image` which supports file upload. We will filter the file extension to support only jpg, jpeg, and png format of images.

We will use Pillow to load the uploaded image.

```python
def read_imagefile(file) -> Image.Image:
    image = Image.open(BytesIO(file))
    return image
```

```python
@app.post("/predict/image")
async def predict_api(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    extension = file.filename.split(".")[-1] in ("jpg", "jpeg", "png")
    if not extension:
        return "Image must be jpg or png format!"
    image = read_imagefile(await file.read())
    prediction = predict(image)

    return prediction
```


# Final code

```python
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile

from application.components import predict, read_imagefile

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/predict/image")
async def predict_api(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    extension = file.filename.split(".")[-1] in ("jpg", "jpeg", "png")
    if not extension:
        return "Image must be jpg or png format!"
    image = read_imagefile(await file.read())
    prediction = predict(image)

    return prediction


@app.post("/api/covid-symptom-check")
def check_risk(symptom: Symptom):
    return symptom_check.get_risk_level(symptom)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, debug=True)

```
