Deploying a Machine Learning model is a difficult task due to the requirement of large memory and powerful computation. This tutorial focuses on a simple deployment technique that can be used to deploy any Python web app for free.

# Step 1
First of all, you will need a [Heroku](http://heroku.com) id, so go now and register for a free account.

For deploying any Python app on Heroku, we need three files- requirements.txt, runtime.txt, and Procfile.

**requirements.txt** is a normal text file that contains Python packages required to run the app.

**runtime.txt** is a text file that will contain the Python Version you want your app to run on.

**Procfile** will contain the command to launch your web app. For example, you can use

    method 1
    `python application/server/main.py`

    or uvicorn if you are deploying a uvicorn server
    `uvicorn application.server.main:app`

# Step 2
Go to your Heroku [dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) then click on **New** and **create a new app**

<br>
Enter your **App name** and select the Server region that is nearest to your location and click on **Create app**

<br>
# Step 3
After you create the app, you will see the deployment methods ‚Äî Heroku Git, GitHub, and Container Registry. I will use the GitHub method. For this just push your code repository to your GitHub account and then connect to GitHub on Heroku.

Then search the repository and connect it to your Heroku app.

After this, you will see a deploy button, select the branch of your Git repository that you want to be deployed, and click on **deploy**.

Then Heroku will automatically start your deployment üéâüéâ
After deployment, you can access your app from any web browser üî•
