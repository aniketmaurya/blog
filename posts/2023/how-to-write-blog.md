Writing a technical content that optimize for SEO is not always straightforward. You need to present the article in the most comprehensible way that can be consumed easily by English and non-English speakers *(if you're writing in English)*.

**Who am I to talk about this?** My blog [How To Finetune GPT Like Large Language Models on a Custom Dataset](https://lightning.ai/pages/blog/how-to-finetune-gpt-like-large-language-models-on-a-custom-dataset/) was trending on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36068850) and as a developer advocate at Lightning AI, I have been publishing articles and blog posts on Machine Learning, AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) that boosted the overall web traffic and community engagement.
